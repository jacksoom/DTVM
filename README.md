   * Integrates code generation, security auditing, and repair workflows
   * Achieves 80%+ vulnerability detection accuracy and 85%+ automated repair success rates
   * Implements retrieval-augmented generation for smart contract lifecycle automation
   * Enhances development productivity and security

The DTVM Engine introduces a Lazy-JIT compilation framework(code name is **ZetaEngine**) with Wasm runtime environment.

**ZetaEngine** is specifically tailored for blockchain smart contract environments, providing a high-performance, secure, and cross-platform deterministic execution runtime. It offers a comprehensive suite of blockchain-specific design features, addressing the unique challenges of distributed computing and smart contract execution. The engine delivers exceptional performance, robust security mechanisms, and guaranteed cross-platform consistency critical for blockchain and decentralized application (dApp) ecosystems.

# Introduction

ZetaEngine currently supports three execution modes: `lazy-jit` mode (also known as `multipass`, which includes `FLAT` and `FLAS` modes), `singlepass` mode, and `interpreter` mode.

**FLAT Mode** : Function Level fAst Transpile mode

**FLAS Mode**: Function Level Adaptive hot-Switching mode

ZetaEngine provides comprehensive programming interfaces in C++, C, and Rust, enabling seamless integration as both a library and a command-line tool for Wasm execution. 
Additionally, it offers native support for Intel SGX enclaves, ensuring secure execution in trusted environments.

### Lazy JIT

The Lazy-JIT compilation framework (ZetaEngine) incorporates two execution modes: FLAT mode for rapid execution and FLAS mode for optimized performance. These modes can seamlessly switch between each other when Lazy-JIT is enabled.

`Lazy JIT` relies on `LLVM` 15 for code generation. You can install llvm-15 by download pre-built llvm 15 from github.

Then, build ZetaEngine with `Lazy JIT` (multipass JIT) mode:

```cpp
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DZEN_ENABLE_MULTIPASS_JIT=ON -DLLVM_DIR=<llvm-path>/lib/cmake/llvm -DLLVM_SYS_150_PREFIX=<llvm-path>
cmake --build build
```

Consult: [docs/user-guide.md](docs/user-guide.md) for other CMake options.

Note: Lazy JIT currently only supports the x86-64 target.

### Other Modes

DTVM also provides a standalone singlepass JIT and an interpreter by default. User can try this simple version via below instructions

***Singlepass JIT***

Singlepass JIT mode offers a lightweight alternative that doesn't require LLVM installation. It provides cross-platform compatibility, supporting both x86 and ARM64 architectures for flexible deployment options.

Build commands:

```cpp
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DZEN_ENABLE_SINGLEPASS_JIT=ON
cmake --build build
```

***Interpreter***

Build commands:

```cpp
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build
```

For more CMake options, consult: [docs/user-guide.md](docs/user-guide.md)

## Use as a C/C++ library

You can include the `src/zetaengine.h` or `src/zetaengine-c.h` in you projects, and link the built `libzetaengine.a` to use ZetaEngine in your C/C++ project.

Refer to the `example/c_api/main.c` file for an example of how to incorporate ZetaEngine into a C project.

## Use as a Rust library

Refer to [rust_crate/README.md](rust_crate/README.md) for more details.

## DTVM Contract SDKs

DTVM provides official SDKs for developing smart contracts in different programming languages:

## Command-Line Execution
Execute a `wasm` file using `dtvm` as follows:
```cpp
dtvm -f add i32.wasm --fargs "2 3"

dtvm i32.wasm --repl
webassembly>add 1 1
0x2:i32

dtvm --dir . -f add i32.wasm --fargs "3 1"
0x4:i32

dtvm --mode interpreter i32.wasm

dtvm --mode singlepass i32.wasm

dtvm --mode multipass i32.wasm

```

### Specification Tests （UT）
Enable `ZEN_ENABLE_SPEC_TEST` during compilation.

<a name="kjNq3"></a>
#### Execute All Cases

```cpp
cd build
ctest --verbose

or

./build/specUnitTests 0  // interpreter mode
    
./build/specUnitTests 1  // singlepass mode
    
./build/specUnitTests 2  // multipass mode
```
<a name="GDqeE"></a>
#### Execute a Single Case
When testing a single case, specify the case name (without the `.wast` suffix):

```cpp
./build/specUnitTests i32 0  // interpreter mode

./build/specUnitTests i32 1  // singlepass mode

./build/specUnitTests i32 2  // multipass mode
```
<a name="LZOpW"></a>
#### Custom wast Case Testing
For custom `wast` tests, create a new directory under `tests/spec` and place your test there. For example, <br /> if the relative path is `tests/spec/mytest/demo.wast`, run:

```cpp
./build/specUnitTests mytest/demo <0/1/2>
```
